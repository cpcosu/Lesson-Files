## Introduction
Here's a basic introduction of what you need to know to get started with competitive programming in C++. 
This intro assumes you have some basic experience programming in C/C++. However, if you're at 
square 1, [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm) and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus) have good content to start off with.

## Environment
All you need to run C++ is a text editor and a compiler. However, we'd recommend using an IDE to streamline the process. 
To get started, set up [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp) and the C++ compiler.
