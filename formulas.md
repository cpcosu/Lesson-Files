## Math
### First n Natural Numbers
If you want to count the sum of numbers 1, 2, 3, ... n, you can use the formula:
$$\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$
or
```
sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2
```

## Physics
### Distance
$$x_{f} = x_{i} + vt + at^{2}$$
or
```
distance_final = distance_initial + (velocity * time) + (acceleration * time * time)
```

### Velocity
$$v_{f} = v_{i} + at$$
or
```
velocity_final = velocity_initial + acceleration * time
```
